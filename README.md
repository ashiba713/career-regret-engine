Regreta

Regreta is an AI-based career decision engine that simulates multiple possible future outcomes to help users choose career paths with lower long-term regret. By modeling factors such as skills, risk tolerance, financial pressure, effort capacity, and stability needs, Regreta evaluates alternative career scenarios using a regret-minimization framework.

Instead of relying on generic advice or short-term success metrics, the system provides data-driven foresight to support more resilient and future-oriented career decisions.
